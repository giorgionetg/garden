- Hi, I'm **Giorgio Tedesco** and here I would like to explore some dev's fields and skills I have in my bag.
- I love coding and I started a lot of years ago. I was in Highschool when I had my first touch with code (#html, #css, #js). At that time internet was slow, books were expensive and the only way to learn was to inspect the code at browser.
- I studied frontend only [[Before 2000]], while at university I started to dive around server side tech with #wamp (windows apache, mysql, php). Only spaghetti code, view inside logic and a lot of include at start of the file.
- Still at university (2002-2008) I discovered MVC framework like #cakePhp, #Symfony, and #Silex too. While I never detach my learning about #3DGraphics.
