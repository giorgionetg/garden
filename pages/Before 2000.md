- At the time of high school I was obsessed from #CGI and #Fx from #hollywood movies.
- I believe in love at first sight. I fallen in love with people, witg the arts, with some specific fields ( #CG & #Breakdance ).
- To know what exactly means: watching backstage's movies without ever seen the movie. It means to be focused in a single aspet of **how movies are done**.
- I love to be honest, living without passion it's no living at all.
- So, in high school I never lost a magazine on Computer Graphics and I remember as yesterday my first 3D Studio Dos release installation and my emotions to have on my PC this tool. 3D Studio Dos release counted about 14 floppies disk.
- From #[[Web Development]] side, the magazine often came with an explorable CD with media inside. It was just a html website on Disk, so it was my first approach at #HTML #CSS and #JavaScript
- Studying these technologies, my last exams in high school was made with the same #Techs instead of a PowerPoint or Slides. It was my first website I made.
